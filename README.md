# Calculator
Emulates a Simple Scientific Calculator using C
The calcualtor can perform a variety of functions, such as Unary ones (arc, root, abs, etc.), Binary (add, multiply, power, etc.), and store values

# How to Use It
### First Input
It begins by asking you for the first number
```
First Input:
```
This can be a real number, or any of the following special characters: PI, E, C, CA, B, or Q:
* PI: The mathematical constant 3.1415...
* E: The mathematical constant 2.7182...
* C: Clears the number input
* CA: Clears the number input and storage
* B: Stores a number
* Q: Quits the calculator program

### Unary Operations
After recieving its first input, it'll prompt for an operator. It allows you to do any of the following operations: sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan, root, abs, inv, log, and log2
```
First Input: 1984
Operation: root
```
after recieving the operator, it outputs the result
```
First Input: 1984
Operation: root
44.542
```

### Binary Operations
After recieving its first input, it'll prompt for an operator. It allows you to do any of the following operations: + (add), - (subtract), x (multiply), / (divide), ^ (power) 
```
First Input: 1984
Operation: /
```
It'll then ask for a second input
```
First Input: 1984
Operation: /
Second Input: 32
```
after recieving the operator, it outputs the result
```
First Input: 1984
Operation: /
Second Input: 32
62
```
